# Covid face mask detector
```
Dependencies :

Python 3.7
Keras 2.2.4 conda install keras=2.2.4
Tensorflow 1.15 conda install tensorflow-gpu=1.15 or conda install tensorflow
OpenCV-python
ImageDataGEnrator
NumPy
OS
MobileNetV2

Pre-requsite:

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file requirements.txt

Features: 

My face mask detector didn't uses any morphed masked images dataset. 
The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s also efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model

Model accuracy is 0.99
